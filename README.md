Hello,

<br>

My name is Sid Su, and this is the source repo for my website. You can visit it
by going to [sidsu.com](https://www.sidsu.com).

It is a static site written in HTML-CSS-Javascript, without any fancy docbook
compilation or anything like that.

Feel free to make issues or pull requests about things I'm doing wrong. I'm
still new to web design (and frontend as a whole), so if I'm committing any faux
pas, I would love to know.

I hope my website is well designed, and shows off some of my passions and work,
and I thank you for visiting my page!

<br>

~~Bisous~~,

Elbow Bump,

Sid Su 5-22-24
