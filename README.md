Hello,

<br>

My name is Sid Su, and this is the source repo for my website. You can visit it
by going to [sidsu.com](https://www.sidsu.com).

It is a static site written in HTML-CSS-Javascript, without any fancy docbook
compilation or anything like that.

Feel free to make issues or pull requests about things I'm doing wrong. I'm
still new to web design (and frontend as a whole), so if I'm committing any faux
pas, I would love to know.

I hope my website is well designed, and shows off some of my passions and work,
and I thank you for visiting my page!

<br>

~~Bisous~~,

Elbow Bump,

# Design

**index.html**, **functions.js** and **style.css** are the only notable files
in the root directory

* **index.html** - The landing page of the website

* **functions.js** - Widely used functions in the website. Thus far, the only
  function here is the e-mail obfuscator, but it could be added to in the
  future

* **style.css** - The main stylesheet of the website

**/docs** contains papers that are featured as links on the landing page. Note
that this is not included in github language stats, because then my entire
profile would just be HTML. I think reports, and non-programming documents
shouldn't really be in the stats, so it is excluded.

**/media** contains images, audio and video for the website.
