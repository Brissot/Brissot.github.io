        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          A lot of people really have no idea what they're doing when it comes to
          making Instagram posts, especially with the carousel. Often, there are small
          decisions that make or break posts. Hopefully, this guide will serve to
          assist with making posts, so that people's profiles look better overall.

    <h3>I. Photo Shoot</h3>
    <p>
      Photography is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however there are some
      important considerations if the intended medium is an Instagram post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Request whoever takes the photo to take both a landscape and a portrait
      mode photo.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it's a group photo, be mindful of how the layout will look. Try to be
      symmetrical, and prefer more rows rather than more spread out. This is
      important for cropping.
    </p>

    <h3>II. Aspect Ratios and Cropping</h3>
    <p>Instagram supports 3 aspect ratios for posts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1:1 (square)</li>
      <li>4:5 (portrait)</li>
      <li>16:9 (landscape)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Choose the aspect ratio based on the content being posted. Crop to frame
      photos as well as possible, adhering to the usual rules of photography.
      Don't post landscapes in portrait mode, and don't post portraits in
      landscape mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prefer portrait in cases where more than one aspect ratio can work.
      Instagram is a mobile first platform, and portrait fills the screen the
      most on a mobile device.
    </p>
    <p>Advantages of portrait</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes up more of the screen</li>
      <li>Often more “Dynamic” and closer to the subject</li>
    </ul>
    Advantages of square
    <ul>
      <li>Works better with more photos (landscape and portrait can both
        usually be cropped down to square)</li>
      <li>Better look in the profile overview. It's the post, but shrunk,
        not cropped</li>
    </ul>
    Advantages of landscape
    <ul>
      <li>Flexibility in shooting. In practice, photo subjects tend to be
        wider rather than taller. Think group pictures, buildings, bands,
        sports, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>III. Picture Choice and Ordering</h3>
    <p>You want to tell a story. Usually how I have it:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Cover Photo: An Action shot of the most interesting part of the
        event/theme/subject of the post. This should be the most interesting
        photo that catches the viewer's eye.</li>
      <li>Group/Summary Photo: A photo that shows who was there or what the
        event is about as a whole. Less interesting than the cover
        photo.</li>
      <li>(photos 3 to n - 2) Body photos: Things that happened in the
        event, photos with people you care about, etc.</li>
      <li>Photo n-1: Something to get us back on track. Usually less
        interesting, and might not include people. For instance feet in the
        middle, or hands in the middle, something like that</li>
      <li>Final photo: Something the most silly or most serious that
        concludes the post.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The point is to tell a story. A good rule of thumb is you should be
      able to write a short paragraph based on the post photo by photo</p>
    <p>It's important to note that having a bunch of group photos often is
      annoying and gets boring.</p>
    <h3 id="iv.-filtering-and-edits">IV. Filtering and Edits</h3>
    <p>Filters are bad at making the subject look beautiful. Don't use
      filters as a way of making yourself more beautiful. It's easy to tell
      when someone is doing it for that reason. Instead, think of filters as a
      means of color correction, or as a way to fix the lighting of a photo.
      If the picture as a whole looks beautiful, then you will look better as
      a result as well</p>
    <p>In circumstances where edits must be made to the photo, bring it onto
      the computer into Gimp, Photoshop or any other program. I prefer that it
      is obvious the photo is edited in some way, but with the edits keeping
      in the theme of the photo. Additionally, when saving, save as a PNG so
      that nothing is lost on the saving process. Although lossless
      compression usually results in huge photos, Instagram will always
      re-encode the photos to their own small jpg format anyways, and with
      recent technology lossless image compression isn't that bad anyhow.</p>
    <h3>V. Descriptions</h3>
    <h4>Sentiment and Descriptions</h4>
    <p>
      Keep it simple, stupid. That's not to say you can't say something heartfelt,
      but format it so that there's a short description at the top no more than
      1-2 sentences, then a longer description afterwards. No one is reading the
      whole thing if it's long from the start, so give them a summary of what
      you're going to say, then get sentimental.
    </p>
    <h4>Hashtags</h4>
    <p>
      Limit yourself to &le; 8 hashtags. From a ranking optimization standpoint,
      Instagram seems to recommend this.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for which hashtags, you want to find hashtags that aren't too popular,
      but also one that some people use. Ideally, you will appear at the top, or
      at least on the hashtag page when you post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly though, hashtags are pretty irrelevant. It matters a lot more the
      content of the post. Think to yourself, "why would someone want to view this
      post?"
    </p>
