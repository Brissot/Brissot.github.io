    <h3 id="basic-information">Basic Information</h3>
    <p>Officially <strong>The Kingdom of the Netherlands</strong>, split
      into four constituent countries, Aruba, Curacao, The Netherlands and
      Sint Maarten.</p>
    <p>King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima and Princess Catharina-Amalia
      (heir apparent).</p>
    <p>Unitary Bicameral Government:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Unitary - All power is held by parliament called the States
          General, with a prime minister (currently Mark Rutte), chosen by the
          largest political party.</p></li>
      <li><p>Bicameral - the States General is split into a House of
          Representatives and a Senate.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>12 Provinces of the Netherlands: Drenthe, Flevoland, Friesland,
      Gelderland, Groningen, Limburg, North Brabant, North Holland,

    <h3 id="name">Name</h3>
    <p>The Netherlands is low in elevation, and is where the Rhine river
      delta forms.</p>
    <p>“Netherlands” comes from Austrian Habsburg documents where the
      province was called “pays d’embas” (“lands down-here”), which was
      translated to Dutch as Neder-landen.</p>
    <p>Eventually this became Netherlands or Low Countries.</p>
    <p>“Holland” is the name of the province that contains Amsterdam, but
      because of its importance in the Dutch Revolt, it’s often used to refer
      to the whole country. Dutch people don’t like it when people do
      though.</p>
    <p>“Dutch” originally referred to all German speakers in English, but
      over time came to refer to West German speakers, and then the people
      around the Netherlands.</p>
    <h3 id="history">History</h3>
    <p><strong>Hanseatic League (Late 1100s-1500s)</strong> - A Baltic Sea
      trade league. Notable Dutch cities include Zwolle, Kampen and
      Deventer.</p>
    <p><strong>Dukes of Burgundy (1384-1482)</strong> - The French Duke of
      Burgundy came to acquire much of the Netherlands by inheritance,
      purchase and seizure.</p>
    <p><strong>Habsburg Netherlands (1482-1797)</strong> - The Habsburg
      monarchy inherited the possessions of the Duke of Burgundy, resulting in
      the Habsburg Netherlands.</p>
    <p><strong>Reformation (16th Century)</strong> - Calvinism, and to a
      lesser extent Lutheranism spread through the Netherlands.</p>
    <p><strong>Dutch Revolt (80 Years War) (1566-1648)</strong> - Due to the
      despotism of Phillip II of Spain (von Habsburg), the North Dutch
      provinces went into revolt. This was mainly due to high taxes and
      intolerance of Calvinism. Although the Spanish were successful in all
      parts of the war, Spanish resources were tied up in other areas. The
      Battle of Lepanto (1571), Spanish Armada (1588) and finally the 30 Years
      War (1618-1648) bankrupted the Spanish Empire, prolonging the war.
      However, Spanish commitment to the war ended due to internal revolts in
      Catalonia, Castile and Leon.</p>
    <p>The Dutch would formally gain independence in the Peace of Westphalia
      (1648).</p>
    <p><strong>Republic of the Seven United Provinces
        (1579-1795)</strong></p>
    <p>Not a very representative republic. All power held by around 2000
      oligarchs, with the Stadtholder as the head of state. Stadtholders are
      not kings, but chosen with the approval of the provinces.</p>
    <p>Holland is the most prosperous province.</p>
    <p>Very Protestant.</p>
    <p>Dutch V.O.C. made them wealthy, resulting in the money to facilitate
      the Dutch Golden Age.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the English E.I.C. would overtake the Dutch by winning
      the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784).</p>
    <p><strong>Revolutionary Era (1795-1815)</strong> - The first
      “sister-republic” during the Revolutionary era as the Batavian Republic
      (1795-1801). Napoleon then created the Kingdom of the Netherlands and
      placed his brother Louis Napoleon on the throne (1801-1806). The kingdom
      would then be incorporated into the First French Empire (1806-1815).</p>
    <p><strong>United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815-1839)</strong> -
      Following the Napoleonic Wars, the Conference of Vienna. Would come
      under turmoil in 1830 due to the Belgian Revolt of the Southern
      Provinces. The Belgian Revolt came about due to dissatisfaction of the
      Catholic South with the ruling Calvinist North. Formal independence of
      Belgian would come with the Treaty of London (1839).</p>
    <p><strong>Kingdom of the Netherlands (1839-Present)</strong> - The
      Netherlands began to colonize, resulting in the 4 kingdoms we see
      today.</p>
    <p>During World War I the Netherlands remained neutral.</p>
    <p>During the Great Depression, the Netherlands traded with her colonies
      to mitigate the effects of the depression.</p>
    <p>Would War II invaded by Germans; Rotterdam was firebombed and
      destroyed. Dutch East Indies invaded by Japan.</p>
    <p><strong>Postwar</strong> - Dutch Industry thrived, notably with Dutch
      Royal Shell and Phillips. The Dutch constructed the Delta Works to deal
      with flooding, and the last major flood took place in 1953. The
      Netherlands joined the European Community, then the European Union.</p>
