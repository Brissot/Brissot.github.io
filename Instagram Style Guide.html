  <p>A lot of people really have no idea what they're doing when it comes
  to making Instagram posts, especially with the carousel. Often, there
  are small decisions that make or break posts. Hopefully, this guide will
  serve to assist with making posts, so that people's profiles look better
  overall.</p>
  <h3 id="i.-photo-shoot">I. Photo Shoot</h3>
  <p>Photography is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however there are
  some important considerations if the intended medium is an Instagram
  post.</p>
  <p>Request whoever takes the photo to take both a landscape and a
  portrait photo.</p>
  <p>If it's a group photo, be mindful of how the layout will look. Try to
  be symmetrical, and prefer more rows rather than more spread out. This
  is important for cropping.</p>
  <h3 id="ii.-aspect-ratios-and-cropping">II. Aspect Ratios and
  Cropping</h3>
  <p>Instagram supports 3 aspect ratios for posts:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>1:1 (square)</p></li>
  <li><p>4:5 (portrait)</p></li>
  <li><p>16:9 (landscape)</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Choose the aspect ratio based on the content being posted. Crop to
  frame photos as well as possible, adhering to the usual rules of
  photography. Don't post landscapes in portrait mode, and don't post
  portraits in landscape mode.</p>
  <p>Prefer portrait in cases where more than one aspect ratio can work.
  Instagram is a mobile first platform, and portrait fills the screen the
  most on a mobile device.</p>
  <p>Advantages of portrait</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Takes up more of the screen</p></li>
  <li><p>Often more “Dynamic” and closer to the subject</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Advantages of square</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Works better with more photos (landscape and portrait can both
  usually be cropped down to square)</p></li>
  <li><p>Better look in the profile overview. It's the post, but shrunk,
  not cropped</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Advantages of landscape</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Flexibility in shooting. In practice, photo subjects tend to be
  wider rather than taller. Think group pictures, buildings, bands,
  sports, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="iii.-picture-choice-and-ordering">III. Picture Choice and
  Ordering</h3>
  <p>You want to tell a story. Usually how I have it:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><p>Cover Photo: An Action shot of the most interesting part of the
  event/theme/subject of the post. This should be the most interesting
  photo that catches the viewer's eye.</p></li>
  <li><p>Group/Summary Photo: A photo that shows who was there or what the
  event is about as a whole. Less interesting than the cover
  photo.</p></li>
  <li><p>(photos 3 to n - 2) Body photos: Things that happened in the
  event, photos with people you care about, etc.</p></li>
  <li><p>Photo n-1: Something to get us back on track. Usually less
  interesting, and might not include people. For instance feet in the
  middle, or hands in the middle, something like that</p></li>
  <li><p>Final photo: Something the most silly or most serious that
  concludes the post.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The point is to tell a story. A good rule of thumb is you should be
  able to write a short paragraph based on the post photo by photo</p>
  <h3 id="iv.-filtering-and-edits">IV. Filtering and Edits</h3>
  <p>Filters are bad at making the subject look beautiful. Don't use
  filters as a way of making yourself more beautiful. It's easy to tell
  when someone is doing it for that reason. Instead, think of filters as a
  means of color correction, or as a way to fix the lighting of a photo.
  If the picture as a whole looks beautiful, then you will look better as
  a result as well</p>
  <p>In circumstances where edits must be made to the photo, bring it onto
  the computer into Gimp, Photoshop or any other program. I prefer that it
  is obvious the photo is edited in some way, but with the edits keeping
  in the theme of the photo. Additionally, when saving, save as a PNG so
  that nothing is lost on the saving process. Although lossless
  compression usually results in huge photos, Instagram will always
  re-encode the photos to their own small jpg format anyways, and with
  recent technology lossless image compression isn't that bad anyhow.</p>
  <h3 id="v.-descriptions">V. Descriptions</h3>
  <p>Keep it simple, stupid. That's not to say you can't say something
  heartfelt, but format it so that there's a short description at the top
  no more than 1-2 sentences, then a longer description afterwards. No one
  is reading the whole thing if it's long from the start, so give them a
  summary of what you're going to say, then get sentimental.</p>
