<h1>Why Not Monthly Resolutions?</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>UPDATE <time datetime="2025-09-17">(9-17-25)</time>. I have written up my
first post about my first monthly
resolution&mdash;<a href="/blog/Personal%20Finance">having a clearer
understanding of my finances</a>.

<p>New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions are terrible. The time between the start and
the end of the year is longer than anyone can hold in their mind at once.
Moveover, what&rsquo;s relevant to make a resolution of may not even be the
same from the start to the end, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have a
singular resolution throughout the entire year. It&rsquo;s no wonder why over
half of respondents report they drop their resolution after just 3 months, with
just 7% making it the whole year (Lloyd).</p>

<p>It follows that if everyone quits their resolutions after a few months, then
months are what resolutions should be measured in. I propose moving from
whole-year resolutions to monthly resolutions with optional year-long themes
based on S.M.A.R.T goals.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Related, Time-bound">
S.M.A.R.T</abbr> Goals</h2>

<p>Most people at this point are familiar with
<abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Related, Time-bound">
S.M.A.R.T</abbr> goals, yet I would guess that most are also unfamiliar with
the original account of S.M.A.R.T goals from 1981. S.M.A.R.T goals emerged out
of a business management periodical trying to answer the question <q>How do I
lead a department without making false promises?</q> George T. Doran states,
<q>[Operating Managers are] busy producing, they usually don&rsquo;t want to
take time to put something on paper that they feel may or may not commit them
to a situation in which they may or may not have control over the variables</q>
(Doran 35).</p>

<p>Thus S.M.A.R.T goals are a way to control the variables by stating them
outright:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;target a specific area for improvement.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;quantify or at least suggest an indicator of
progress.<br>
<em>Assignable</em>&mdash;specify who will do it.<br>
<em>Realistic</em>&mdash;state what results can realistically be achieved,
given available resources.<br>
<em>Time-related</em>&mdash;specify when the result(s) can be achieved. (Doran
36)
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, after hundreds of variants of S.M.A.R.T over the years, the
content of the acronym is mostly the same, save for <q>A</q>&mdash;which is now
usually <q>Attainable</q> instead of <q>Assignable</q></p>

<p>Another interesting part of the original article is that it does not try to
force strict adherence to S.M.A.R.T, <q>It should be understood that the
suggested acronym doesn&rsquo;t mean that every objective will have all five
criteria. However, the closer we get to the S.M.A.R.T criteria as a guideline,
the smarter our objectives will be</q> (Doran 36). That is, if you get caught
up in the details too much, you won&rsquo;t make good S.M.A.R.T goals.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Monthly Resolutions</h2>

<p>What I suggest is to still create a year-long resolution if you would like,
but supplement them with monthly resolutions in the form of S.M.A.R.T goals.
</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p><strong>More start times</strong>&mdash;it&rsquo;s harder to get into the
mindset of <q>oh, I already dropped it this once, I might as well drop it
again.</q></p>
<p><strong>More focused goals</strong>&mdash;you can really internalize that
you only have 4&frac12; weeks to make something happen, so you&rsquo;re more
encouraged to start.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities to reflect</strong>&mdash;after the 4&frac12; weeks,
you have some time to reflect on how you did that month, so you can improve
your processes for the next month and the next resolution</p>
<p><strong>Timeline flexibility</strong>&mdash;if a resolution takes longer
than a month, you can break it up into a multiple month goal. You aren&rsquo;t
stuck with a set of New Year&rsquo;s resolutions which may have completely
different timelines</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Connection to Agile</h2>

<p>Those familiar with the Agile methodology will certainly see parallels to
Agile with this approach. We can think of each of the each year as an
<q>Epic</q>, each month as a <q>Sprint</q> and the end of each month as a
<q>Retrospective</q>, but I don&rsquo;t think we should get caught up on the
terminology and formalisms. The key takeaway is that taking small steps tends
to lead to better results when the goal isn&rsquo;t necessarily clearly
defined.</p>

<section>
<h2>I&rsquo;m Going To Do It, Maybe You Should Too</h2>

<p>Starting this month,August, 2025,I am starting monthly resolutions. I have
already done them informally in the past&mdash;July 2024 I had the goal to
<q>be 5&prime; 10&Prime; more often</q> (improve my posture)&mdash;but now I will
more formally set a goal every month and report back on this blog.</p>

<p>My August resolution is to have a clearer understanding of my finances. In
S.M.A.R.T terms looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;I will figure out a method&mdash;paper or
software&mdash;that can help me record my expenses, and view my assets across
all my accounts.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;I will have succeeded if all transactions across all
accounts are recorded, all transactions match and all balances on my ledger
match with the balances on the online ledgers.<br>
<em>Attainable</em>&mdash;I am limiting myself to the month of August to start,
so I do not need to record every transaction I have ever made since I was a
toddler.<br>
<em>Related</em>&mdash;by having everything across all accounts recorded for my
own records, I will have <q>clearer understanding of my finances.</q><br>
<em>Time-bound</em>&mdash;I am looking at the month of August, and must have
everything done by <time datetime="2025-09-01">September 1st</time>.
</blockquote>
