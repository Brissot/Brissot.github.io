<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>New Year's Resolutions are terrible. The time between the start of the
resolution and the end is more than anyone can hold in their mind at once.
The person we are at the beginning of the year rarely mirrors the person we are
at the end, reflecting shifting priorities. It's no wonder over half of
respondents report they drop their resolution after just 3 months, with just 7%
of respondents making it the whole year (Lloyd).</p>

<p>It follows that if everyone quits their resolutions after a few months, then
months are what resolutions should be measured in. I propose moving from
whole-year resolutions to monthly resolutions with optional year-long themes
based on S.M.A.R.T goals.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Related, Time-bound">
S.M.A.R.T</abbr> Goals</h2>

<p>Most people at this point are familiar with
<abbr title="Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Related, Time-bound">S.M.A.R.T
</abbr> goals, yet I would guess that both those familiar and unfamiliar,
don&apos;t know the original account, as it was presented in 1981. S.M.A.R.T
goals emerged out of a business management periodical trying to answer question
<q>How do I lead a department without making false promises?</q> George T.
Doran states, <q>[Operating Managers are] busy producing, they usually
don&apos;t want to take time to put something on paper that they feel may or
may not commit them to a situation in which they may or may not have control
over the variables</q> (Doran 35).</p>

<p>Thus S.M.A.R.T goals are a way to control the variables by stating them
outright:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;target a specific area for improvement.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;quantify or at least suggest an indicator of
progress.<br>
<em>Assignable</em>&mdash;specify who will do it.<br>
<em>Realistic</em>&mdash;state what results can realistically be achieved,
given available resources.<br>
<em>Time-related</em>&mdash;specify when the result(s) can be achieved. (Doran
36)
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, after hundreds of variants of S.M.A.R.T over the years, the
content of the acronym is mostly the same, save for <q>A</q>&mdash;which is now
usually <q>Attainable</q> instead of <q>Assignable</q></p>

<p>Another interesting part of the original article is that it does not try to
force strict adherence to S.M.A.R.T, <q>It should be understood that the
suggested acronym doesn't mean that every objective will have all five
criteria. However, the closer we get to the S.M.A.R.T criteria as a guideline,
the smarter our objectives will be</q> (Doran 36). That is, if you get caught
up in the details too much, you won&apos;t make good S.M.A.R.T goals.</p>
</section>

<h2>Monthly Resolutions</h2>

<p>What I suggest is to still create a year-long resolution if you would like,
but supplement them with monthly resolutions in the form of S.M.A.R.T goals.
</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p><strong>More start times</strong>&mdash;it's harder to get into the mindset
of <q>oh, I already dropped it this once, I might as well drop it again.</q>
</p>
<p><strong>More focused goals</strong>&mdash;you can really internalize that
you only have 4&frac12; weeks to make something happen, so you're more
encouraged to start.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities to reflect</strong>&mdash;after the 4&frac12; weeks,
you have some time to reflect on how you did that month, so you can improve
your processes for the next month and the next resolution</p>
<p><strong>Timeline flexibility</strong>&mdash;if a resolution takes longer
than a month, you can break it up into a multiple month goal. You aren't stuck
with a set of New Year's resolutions which may have completely different
timelines</p>
</section>

<h2>Connection to Agile</h2>

<p>Those familiar with the Agile methodology will no doubt see parallels to
Agile in this approach. Certainly, we can think of each of the each year year
as an <q>Epic</q>, each month as a <q>Sprint</q> and the end of each month as a
<q>Retrospective</q>, but I don&apos;t think we should get caught up on the
terminology and formalisms. The key takeaway is that taking small steps tends
to lead to better results when the goal isn&apos;t necessarily clearly defined.
</p>

<h2>I&apos;m Going To Do It, Maybe You Should Too</h2>

<p>Starting this month&mdash;August, 2025&mdash;I am starting monthly
resolutions. I had already done them informally in the past&mdash;July 2024 I
had the goal to <q>be 5&apos; 10&quot; more often</q> (improve my posture), but
now I will more formally set a goal every month and report back on this blog.
</p>

<p>August is to have a clearer understanding of my finances, which in S.M.A.R.T
terms looks like</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;I will figure out a method&mdash;paper or
software&mdash;that can help me record my expenses, and view my assets across
all my accounts.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;I will have succeeded if all transactions across all
accounts are recorded, all transactions match and all balances on my ledger
match with the balances on the online ledgers.<br>
<em>Attainable</em>&mdash;I am limiting myself to the month of August to start,
so I do not need to record every transaction I have ever made since I was a
toddler.<br>
<em>Related</em>&mdash;by having everything across all accounts recorded for my
own records, I will have <q>clearer understanding of my finances.</q><br>
<em>Time-bound</em>&mdash;I am looking at the month of August, and must have
everything done by <time datetime="2025-09-01">September 1st</time>.
</blockquote>

<p>I'll link to my progress once I type up my post.</p>
