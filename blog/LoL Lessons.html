<h1>Lessons I Learned From 15 Years of League of Legends</h1>
<address>Sid Su | <time datetime="2025-11-04">Nov. 4, 2025</time></address>
</header>

<p>Recently, I have been reflecting on my time playing League of Legends, or
<q>League</q> for short, or <q>LoL</q>&mdash;if you&rsquo;re an old-timer. I
have been mainly reflecting on how it has shaped me as a person, and the way I
manage conflict.</p>

<p>My motivation was a conversation that I had with two different friends on a
few fairly common topics.</p>

<blockquote>
(1) How do you deal with people flaking on your events?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
(2) How do you deal with someone who is clearly trying to beef with you?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
(3) How do you deal with someone who doesn&rsquo;t do the chores assigned to
them on the chore chart?
</blockquote>

<p>My suggestion to all of these is to act indirectly, or reframe what the
problem in a positive way. For (1), reach out to people individually next time
instead of sending a text that you&rsquo;re hurt they didn&rsquo;t show up. For
(2), kill them with kindness and act oblivious to the beefing. Instead of
stirring the pot, reframe what they say positively. For (3), don&rsquo;t think
of chores as a collective punishment that everyone has to do, but rather as a
team effort to victory&mdash;a clean house. In all of these cases, I can
definitely see the counter-arguments, but I still think that my ideas are
compelling.</p>

<section id="flaming">
<h2>Why Flaming Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h2>

<p>For (1), (2) and (3) the most common reaction is to flame the offending
person. From my experience both on
<a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/Summoner%27s_Rift">the Rift</a>
and IRL, flaming doesn&rsquo;t ever result in a good outcome. In game, all
flaming does is cause your teammate to play worse, or even worse convince them
to start sabatoging your efforts. Ego is a fickle thing, and it&rsquo;s
important to not hurt egos if you want to get your way.</p>

<p><em>People are trying their best</em>&mdash;they are your teammates, not
your enemies. It&rsquo;s better to enable your teammates to play better rather
than telling them that they messed up
after-the-fact.<sup><a href="#open-door">1</a></sup> In game, this looks like
spam pinging 30-60 seconds before the dragon spawns, and telling everyone to
come&mdash;rather than getting mad at Top for splitting after everyone else is
dead, instead of showing up to the fight. In real life, you need to act in the
planning phase of the party to get everyone to show up. What I have found that
works best is to work with people on an individual level, by texting them
directly. This way, there&rsquo;s more of a reason to show up than the
distantness of a group text.</p>

<aside id="open-door">
<sup>1</sup>In management, this idea is usually expressed as <q>It&rsquo;s
easier to open a door for someone, than push them through it.</q>
</aside>
</section>

<section id="conflict-resolution">
<h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>Similarly for (2), if you play
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">tit for tat</a>, you should
expect the bridge to further burn. Instead, you should stand up for yourself,
but you should seek to lower the temperature. If they&rsquo;re talking !@#$,
directly confront them in person and try to resolve the misunderstanding. Most
of the time, conflicts are not based in any epistemic
disagreement<sup><a href="#epistemic">1</a></sup>, but rather divergent
understandings of the underlying facts. The key here is that you should
charitably and genuinely try to resolve the misunderstanding assuming it is
just a misunderstanding<sup><a href="#stock">2</a></sup>. Does that mean that
you should roll over have your name relentlessly impugned? Absolutely not, if
things keep coming up, and they refuse to talk, then absolutely go tit for tat.
However, even in the original strategy, you start with cooperation.</p>

<aside id="epistemic">
<p><sup>1</sup>A disagreement on what is moral, or <q>right.</q></p>
</aside>

<aside id="stock">
<p><sup>2</sup>As the logician Frank Ramsey once put it, add it to your
<q>stock of knowledge</q> for the consequent. In this case, that they were
acting in good faith and charitably.</p>
</aside>
</section>

<section id="agency">
<h2>You Have Agency</h2>

<p>For (3), I think that framing chores as a collective punishment that we all
must endure leads to bad outcomes. That if someone doesn&rsquo;t do their
chores, they are transferring the punishment onto the other members of the
house.</p>

<p>I think that this framing misses the point. Everyone wants the house to be
clean, that is how you <q>win</q> living in a house. Just like how in game you
may need to carry by winning all the fights and <em>leading</em> your team to
victory, the same applies with chores. If that means that you personally do
more chores, yes it may suck, but it&rsquo;s better to just pick up the slack
and <em>carry</em> rather than hoping for everything to be perfect.
That&rsquo;s not to say that you don&rsquo;t try to get your housemates to do
the chores at all, but you need to lead by example. While housemates are
around, start cleaning the kitchen and either implicitly or explicitly ask for
help in cleaning. Give status reports, and specific things that can be done. If
you have just wiped the countertops, directly ask for another to vaccum the
floor. You may be doing more chores, but you will have also won the
<q>game</q> and collected 20LP, so does it really matter?</p>

<p>What I want to stress is that my strategy is not avoiding confrontation or
being afraid of it, but rather picking and choosing what confrontation you do
in order to maximize <em>outcomes</em> for yourself. Framing is everything.
Just like how in-game if you say <q>I think that&hellip;</q> you will likely
get told to <q>Stop thinking, noob</q>. You need to frame what you say
positively to achieve your outcomes.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>My last game of League of Legends was on <time datetime="2025-04-15">April
15, 2025</time>, and while it was a good time, I am currently trying to play
other games more often. That&rsquo;s not to say League of Legends doesn&rsquo;t
have a special place in my heart. Whether is was the 3000+ hours that&rsquo;s
causing Stockholm syndrome, or a genuine love, I don&rsquo;t regret my time.
It&rsquo;s shaped me to who I am. How to deal with loss and conflict. How to
realize that what it might not be obvious sometimes, I do have
agency.<sup><a href="#elo-hell">1</a></sup></p>

<p>As always, Teemo jungle forever &lt;3. Play to improve.</p>

<aside id="elo-hell">
<p><sup>1</sup>This comes from the idea of <q>ELO Hell</q>, which is when your
teammates are worse than your enemies, meaning you can&rsquo;t climb. ELO Hell
is a myth, because the enemies are on average the same level as skill as your
teammates, but you control 1/5 of your team, meaning you can make you team on
average better than the enemy team. It&rsquo;s hard to realize this in person
because it takes ~100 games for the averages to make a difference, hence the
prevalence of the myth.</p>
