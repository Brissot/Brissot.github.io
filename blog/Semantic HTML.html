<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Most of the HTML on the modern web is unreadable garbage with more
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags than actual HTML. Furthermore, the content of
the page&mdash;the actual text, images, videos, games, etc.&mdash;are often
inserted by a JavaScript library into a single line, making it hard to parse
what is actually happening on the page. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, go to
almost any major website, right click and select <code>View Page Source</code>.
What you will likely see is a jumbled mess of automatically generated HTML
inserted between, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags and
<code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<p>This is not just a code aesthetic problem. Almost every major website does
not pass W3 validation (Googlebot). Website weight&mdash;a measure of how much
data is transferred to load a given web page has gone up every year since we
started tracking it (HTTP Archive: Page Weight). Finally, a lack of semantic
tags&mdash;using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for everything&mdash;has made the web
less accessible than ever before (accessiBe).</p>

<p>People will often argue <q>yes, modern HTML is unreadable, but it is a
necessary byproduct of making web development ergonomic and feasible</q>. I
argue that this itself is an outdated assessment, especially since the majority
of websites are still not very dynamic, nor do they need to be. They consist of
static text, images and links. Rather than complex frameworks, we ought to be
making more websites with Semantic HTML, which is ergonomic and fun to write
directly.</p>

<section id="semantic-html">
<h2>What Is Semantic HTML?</h2>

<p>Semantic HTML is just using tags such as <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> instead of
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>&mdash;and using tags such as <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;address&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>
instead of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. These tags have the advantage of
conveying meaning in themselves throughout the document. Whereas before meaning
would be communicated through classes and ids.<sup>1</sup></p>

<aside>
<p><sup>1</sup>That&rsquo;s not to say classes and ids don&rsquo;t have a place
anymore, rather they can take on more specialized roles because the tags are
themselves doing what the classes were doing, and can by styled in the CSS
as top level tags instead of 50 different classes or ids. For instance, I have
a <code>bib</code> class, which styles the works cited section to have a
hanging indent.</p>

<section id="semantic-html-advantages">
<h2>Advantages of Semantic HTML</h2>

<dl>
<dt>More Readable Structure</dt>
<dd>An article should <em>always</em> be the start of a self-contained portion
of the webpage, a code segment is <em>always</em> some monospaced-text portion,
a section is <em>always</em> a cohesive part of the content. When this idea is
placed throughout the whole document, it&rsquo;s easy for someone familiar with
Semantic HTML to know what&rsquo;s happening anywhere in the document.</dd>

<dt>Performant</dt>
<dd>The webpage will be about as performant as possible, because we are working
with just plain HTML.<sup>1</sup></dd>

<dt>Accessible</dt>
<dd>Semantic tags have Aria tags<sup>2</sup> built-in, so it is just a matter
of using the tags correctly, and the website is accessible by screenreaders.
</dd>

<dt>Potential SEO Gains</dt>
<dd>This is changing all the time, but it does seem like better formed pages
seem to get better treatment by search engines.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
<p><sup>1</sup>It is possible to squeeze a little bit of performance through
minifying&mdash;removing unnecessary whitespace, newlines, replacing with the
smallest tags&mdash;but I do not think that is worth it. It will already be
smaller than 99% of the web.</p>
</aside>

<aside>
<p><sup>2</sup>Aria tags specify special meaning for accessibility programs
such as screen readers.</p>

<section id="semantic-html-disadvantages">
<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>While there significant advantages, it is important to also note the
caveats:</p>

<dl>
<dt>MUCH More Typing</dt>
<dd>There is a LOT more typing when writing raw HTML because you need to worry
about which tags to use, and a lot of tags that won&rsquo;t even be seen by the
final user. For instance, every date in this document has been using the
<code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag, but you don&rsquo;t see that. However, it does
help both robots and people assisted by robots understand that the string of
characters is a date, and the computer will present it as a date as opposed to
the number 2025.</dd>

<dt>Steeper Learning Curve</dt>
<dd>Learning the tags does take some time, and if you do pick up Semantic HTML,
you will inevitably go back to old documents to make them up to standards with
all of the semantic tags. I have done so many times. However, once you pick up
the tags, your speed at writing semantic HTML goes up, because you aren&rsquo;t
thinking about which tags to use as much.</dd>

<dt>Bad Tooling</dt>
<dd>Currently all tooling for writing straight HTML is not very good. Simple
things like a spellchecker, or a linter to make sure that the HTML is using all
semantic HTML standards just do not exist right now. The closest thing is the
W3 validator, but that is not checking for a lack of semantic tags, rather it
is just checking that the tags that exist in the document are used correctly.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>I did not find these downsides to be fatal. Once you get the tags down, and
have a few HTML documents you can copy the boilerplate from, productivity with
Semantic HTML will go up. For many, any learning curve is too much, we expect
tools to be intuitive, with a skill floor deep underground. I don&rsquo;t think
that mindset is necessarily right, but that is a philosophical discussion for
another post.</p>
</section>

<section id="semantic-html-style">
<h2>Semantic HTML Style</h2>
<p>Here are style choices that work for me, and some justification behind each
one.</p>

<dl>
<dt>80 Columns</dt>
<dd>I want to write HTML directly, so it must look good in the editor. 80
columns is standard everywhere else, so why not for HTML?</dd>

<dt>Only Ascii</dt>
<dd>This one is a bit controversial, because UTF-8 is widely supported in
browsers. However, <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/mg">mg</a>, one of the
editors I use still does not support UTF-8, so I still only use ascii
characters while editing.</dd>

<dt>Prefer Named HTML Entities</dt>
<dd>Follows directly from the previous style recommendation. For instance,
I could use <code>&amp;#146;</code> to represent &rsquo;, it&rsquo;s more clear
in the code to type <code>&amp;rsquo;</code>.</dd>

<dt>No Indentation</dt>
<dd>Most people online swear by HTML indentation, and it does make sense if the
<strong>layout</strong> is what is emphasized in the HTML document. However, if
we are focusing on <strong>content</strong>, then no indentation makes more
sense. Markdown is also focused on content and does not typically indent, so
neither should HTML.</dd>

<dt>Prefer HTML Figures</dt>
<dd>Prefer creating tables, and text diagrams over immediately reaching for
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. This is just something in general I have been
thinking about related to the overuse of images in papers. Even then, it saves
a lot of bandwidth, and may potentially look nicer to just put a table or
formatted text instead of a full fat image.</dd>

<dt>Prefer Web Components For Dynamic Elements</dt>
<dd>In order to not clutter the HTML document, prefer using Web Components for
complex things.</dd>
</dl>

<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Whether or not you choose to use semantic HTML, I hope that you at least
keep some of the principles in mind when creating your next website. I
understand that sometimes websites can be very complex, and it may not be
viable to make anything but a mess of JavaScript libraries. However, you should
ask yourself if what you are doing really needs to be done with JavaScript and
15 different frameworks, or can HTML or CSS accomplish the same thing for a
much smaller payload and a much more clear codebase. Can it be done reasonably
well as a static website with dynamic components? Or does it really
<em>need</em> to be fully dynamic?</p>

<p>I am genuinely surprised that there&rsquo;s not that much talk about using
Semantic HTML, and that there is next to no tooling around it. It is such a
useful paradigm to build websites around, yet it has been mostly ignored by web
developers as a whole.</p>

<p>As a side note, I was inspired by <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">
The Motherfucking Website</a>, <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">
The Better Motherfucking Website</a> and
<a href="http://thebestmotherfucking.website">The Best Motherfucking
Website</a>.<sup>1</sup>

<aside>
<p><sup>1</sup>I think that <q>The Best Motherfucking Website</q> is actually
the worst of the three. It misses the point that plain HTML is adequate a lot
of the time and despite being a static page brings in a JavaScript framework
for some reason.</p>
