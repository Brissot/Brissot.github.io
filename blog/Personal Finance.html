<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Starting off my <a href="/blog/Monthly%20Resolutions">monthly
resolutions</a>, my August resolution was to have a clearer understanding of my
finances. More specifically, I outlined the S.M.A.R.T goal:

<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;I will figure out a method&mdash;paper or
software&mdash;that can help me record my expenses, and view my assets across
all my accounts.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;I will have succeeded if all transactions across all
accounts are recorded, all transactions match and all balances on my ledger
match with the balances on the online ledgers.<br>
<em>Attainable</em>&mdash;I am limiting myself to the month of August to start,
so I do not need to record every transaction I have ever made since I was a
toddler.<br>
<em>Related</em>&mdash;by having everything across all accounts recorded for my
own records, I will have <q>clearer understanding of my finances.</q><br>
<em>Time-bound</em>&mdash;I am looking at the month of August, and must have
everything done by <time datetime="2025-09-01">September 1st</time>. (Su)
</blockquote>

<p>I believe I was successful in my goal. I looked at several personal finance
applications, and determined that GNUCash is right for me. I now know my assets
and liabilities&mdash;allowing me to calculate my net worth. My expenses are
auditable through receipt files attached to transactions in GNUCash. As of
<time datetime="2025-09-05">September 5th</time> (my statement date), all of my
transactions are accurate to the cent.</p>
</section>

<section id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>My main, obvious, requirement is that I want a practical solution that can
be used day-to-day. The meme in Fig. 1 resonates with me&mdash;mastering simple
tool is better than bringing complex, often cumbersome tools (Maddox). I think
the ends of the bell curve in Fig. 1 should be Excel, but finding a personal
finance software close in versatility and simplicity without the effort should
be the goal.</p>

     alt="Mastery Curve Meme">
<footer>(Maddox)</footer>
</figure>

<h3>Defining specific requirements:</h3>

<dl>
<dt>More Than a Spreadsheet</dt>
<dd>If the solution does less than what a typical budget spreadsheet does, then
there is no reason to use it.</dd>

<dt>Double-Entry Bookkeeping</dt>
<dd>The solution must use double-entry bookkeeping, which improves
auditability. This is not strictly necessary for personal finance, but I want
to learn double-entry bookkeeping, so it is a requirements.<sup>1</sup></dd>

<dt>Ownership of Data</dt>
<dd>I must own my own data, meaning my ledger is viewable and editable from a
file on my computer. Even if my data is locked behind a free SaaS, there have
been cases where previously freely stored user data gets locked behind a
subscription (Freedman).<sup>2</sup></dd>

<dt>Data Portability/Archivability</dt>
<dd>My ledger must be accessible, even if the original solution ceases to
exist. In practice this looks like data stored in a standard
format.<sup>3</sup>

<dt>Efficient Workflow</dt>
<dd>Entering a transaction should not take longer than it takes to put the same
transaction into a spreadsheet.</dd>

<dt>Fast as a Program</dt>
<dd>The solution should be light on system resources. Specifically, I am
targetting no more than 200MiB of RAM, and 10% CPU load.<sup>4</sup></dd>

<dt>Auditability</dt>
<dd>I want to keep receipts organized and digitized, so that I can consult the
original documents to find and correct errors.</dd>

<dt>BONUS: Asset Value Tracking</dt>
<dd>If there is a way to track the value of
<abbr title="Financial instrumuents such as bonds, stocks, mutual funds">
securities</abbr> and currencies, and use them to track the value of an
account, that is a welcome bonus.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
<p><sup>1</sup>Double-entry bookkeeping is a bookkeeping strategy that requires
every transaction to have an account that money is being taken from, and an
account that money is being moved to. In this case, an account can be bank
accounts, expense accounts&mdash;in practice more like expense
categories&mdash;equity accounts and liability accounts&mdash;debt.
Double-entry bookkeeping helps with auditing, because every cent must be
accounted for for the numbers to make sense on both sides or <q>accounts</q> of
the transaction.</p>
</aside>

<aside>
<p><sup>2</sup>Quizlet notoriously locked previously free features and
user-made flashcards and behind a paywall. In the past, the free-tier included
<dfn title="The Spaced Repetition learning mode">Learn</dfn> and
<dfn title="The fill-in-the-blank mode">Write</dfn>, but in
<time datetime="2022-08">August 2022</time> Quizlet heavily limited the free
tier of these modes to 5 uses a day. To regain the previously unlimited access,
a $7.99/month subscription is now required. The option to export flashcards as
a CSV, even as the creator was also removed (Freedman).
</aside>

<aside>
<p><sup>3</sup>A good place to start is the the Library of Congress
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/data.html">Recommended
Formats Statement</a>. It recommends line-oriented
(<abbr title="Tab-Separated Values">TSV</abbr> or
<abbr title="Comma-Separated Values">CSV</abbr>) or open formats such as an
SQLite3 database (<q>Recommended Formats Statement: Datasets</q>).</p>
</aside>

<aside>
<p><sup>4</sup>The accounting software industry is at least 70 years old, so
there is no excuse for programs to be heavy on system resources (Kircher).
Quake&mdash;the real-time 3D graphics game&mdash;targetted 8MiB of RAM and
80MiB of storage (<q>Quake Isn&rsquo;t Earth-Shaking</q>). Desktop software
written in fast compiled languages such as C, C++, Go, Rust and Haskell can
reach my target of &lt;200MiB RAM and &lt;10% CPU load easily.</p>
</aside>
</section>

<section id="software-suck">
<h2>Most Accounting Software Sucks&hellip;</h2>

<p>For a software application category that is 70 years old and a glorified
spreadsheet, it is impressive how bad most accounting applications are. Either
it has a UI/UX design that is feature-complete, but not usable by
humans&mdash;or it takes more system resources than many Xbox 360 games.</p>

<p>To illustrate these issues, these are the unchosen accounting applications I
researched, and the downsides that led me to not choose them:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Quicken Simplifi and <abbr title="You Need A Budget">YNAB</abbr></dt>
<dd>These are the most fully-featured solutions, and have amazing features:

<ul>
<li>Online banking support</li>
<li>Asset price management</li>
<li>Cross-platform support</li>
<li>Beautiful reports</li>
</ul>

However, both are also <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> products
that keep all data on the cloud, meaning I do not own my own data. They rely on
web interfaces, meaning they take at minimum 500MiB of RAM, and 5% CPU load;
they also have slow start-up times because of the 30MiB of CDN images and
JavaScript libraries that must be downloaded. It is unfortunate that Intuit
discontinued the native version of Quicken, because it would have suited my
needs perfectly.</dd>

<dt>Ledger and HLedger</dt>
<dd>These are plain-text accounting or <abbr>PTA</abbr> solutions that have
gained popularity in the last decade. As the name suggests, PTA solutions store
the ledger as a series of human-readable plain-text markup files. Proponents of
PTA say that the format is better suited for version control, allowing for
easier auditing using minimal line-changes. However, from my&mdash;admittedly
brief&mdash;investigation I think PTA has some serious downsides:

<ol>
<li>Plain-text formats lose speed, potential data compression and a significant
amount of tooling compared to structured formats.</li>
<li>Plain-text accounting gives few tools to start, just a command-line
program, making it hard to generate meaningful reports.</li>
<li>Plain-text advocates seem to create their own scripts and tooling, which
they say gives them better control, however tooling and scripting languages are
readily available and powerful for structured formats. SQLite, CSV, XML and
JSON are standard formats that have well documented and open libraries.</li>
<li>Both ledger and hledger do not have a way to attach receipts, reducing
auditability.</li>
<li>If a doomsday event occurs, and we lose the ability to read SQLite, it
is just as likely that we also lose the <code>ext4</code> filesystem,
SATA-compatible connectors and computing as a whole.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Homebank</dt>
<dd>A pretty, fast,x functional accounting application that does almost
everything I want it to&mdash;but it does not have a way to attach receipts,
which is one of my core requirements.</dd>

<dt>Skrooge</dt>
<dd>Similar to HomeBank, but I did give it the time of day because it tries to
increase its search ranking with keywords. If you search for HomeBank, GNUCash
or KMyMoney in package managers, Skrooge will also pop up. This is poor
etiquette, and the Skrooge developers should stop doing this.</dd>

<dt>Firefly III</dt>
<dd>A feature-complete solution that comes with amazing reports and an API
exposing all functionality. It also has the worst UI for anything in this
roundup and for any piece of software that I have ever used. Doing anything
requires a lot of clicking: from making reports, to adding transactions, to
modifying accounts. If someone UI/UX minded came along to create an app using
the API, it would be the best solution, but such an app does not exist.</dd>

<dt>Actual</dt>
<dd>A pretty, easy to use accounting app. It works well&mdash;but is a
single-entry accounting solution.</dd>

<dt>KMyMoney&mdash;The Runner Up</dt>
<dd>A feature complete, powerful and fast accounting tool. It is likely a
little bit better than the solution I chose, as it checks all the boxes just a
little bit better&mdash;but I am primarily on GTK, so in order to keep the
environment looking native, I chose a GTK application.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>No Bad Options</h3>
<p>Despite my criticisms, I understand if use a solutions I chose to skip over.
<q cite="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891126/">Drugs don&rsquo;t work in
patients who don&rsquo;t take them</q> (Lindenfield). If using plain-text
accounting enables you to manage your finances better, then use it. If like
most people you do not care about having to open a web browser to view your
ledger, then do it. It is better that you do something than nothing, and all
the applications listed are capable of doing 95% of what the others can. Avoid
Skrooge though, they have bad etiquette.</p>

</section>

<section id="gnucash">
<h2>GNUCash Does Everything&hellip; Unglamorously</h2>
<p>The accounting solution I ended up choosing is boring and unglamorous.
Having released in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>,
<a href="https://www.gnucash.org">GNUCash</a> is an old piece of software.
However, I see this as an advantage, not a disadvantage. Here are the main
reasons for GNUCash:

<dl>
<dt>Ergonomics</dt>
<dd>GNUCash has had 27 years to become easy to use, with keybinds and layouts
that have been refined over many iterations.</dd>

<dt>Resource Usage</dt>
<dd>GNUCash only uses ~100MiB of RAM, and ~2% CPU, which is within my
requirements.<sup>1</sup></dd>

<dt>Stable, Bug-Free</dt>
<dd>GNUCash has been around so long that I can expect that most breaking
changes were done 10&ndash;20 years ago. It is a stable experience that will
keep working for years to come.</dd>

<dt>Ecosystem</dt>
<dd>Tooling has grown up around GNUCash over the years to do things that are
not available in the basic program. Mainly, this comes in the form of
extensions written in PERL.</dd>

<dt>Double-Entry Bookkeeping</dt>
<dd>GNUCash does double-entry bookkeeping, which was one of my basic
requirements.</dd>

<dt>Archivability</dt>
<dd>GNUCash has the option to save ledgers as either compressed XML, SQLite or
connecting to an external SQL server. Weirdly, the XML is a lot smaller than
SQLite. This is likely due to the XML being compressed, and the SQLite not
being compressed.</dd>
</dl>

<p><sup>1</sup>GNUCash was designed in a different era, when both RAM and
storage was expensive. It is written in C with extensions written in Perl,
making it fast and efficient.</p>
</section>

<section id="using-gnucash">
<h2>Using GNUCash</h2>
<p>It can be easy to get caught in the details of which software is best;
actually using the software is a whole different task. GNUCash has some quirks
to learn, and it can be a bit confusing at first, but I will try to clarify the
parts that confused me. If there are parts that are still confusing, feel
free to reach out to me, and I will add it to this page.</p>

<section>
<h3>Creating a New File</h3>
<p>To start with GNUCash, create a new file by going to
<code>File&rarr;New File</code>.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>Fig. 2. Making a New File in GNUCash</figcaption>
<img loading="lazy"
     src="/media/gnucash-new-file.avif"
     alt="Making a new file in GNUCash">
</figure>

<p>When choosing which accounts to create, do not worry too much about getting
all the accounts right. You can refine them after-the-fact.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>Fig. 3. Choosing Accounts in GNUCash</figcaption>
<img loading="lazy"
     src="/media/gnucash-accounts.avif"
     alt="Creating GNUCash Accounts">
</figure>

<p>Also set opening balances. Again here, do not worry about getting all the
amounts right, because you can and likely will update them later.</p>

<figure>

     src="/media/gnucash-opening-balances.avif"
     alt="Setting Opening Balances">
</figure>

<p>Finally, when saving, choose either XML or SQLite. Either is good, and you
can convert between them in the future. I recommend SQLite, because it is
faster to startup, at the cost of a larger file size due to a lack of
compression.<sup>1</sup></p>

     src="/media/gnucash-file-type.avif"

</figure>

<aside>
<p><sup>1</sup>SQLite benefits from standard tooling outside of GNUCash as
well. SQLite viewers such as <abbr title="DB Browser for SQLite">DB4S</abbr> or
DBeaver can view a GNUCash ledger directly with the <code>transactions</code>
table. SQLite ledgers are significantly larger than with XML&mdash;my ledger
with just August data took 30KiB in XML, and 500KiB in SQLite. This is
significantly bigger, until it is extrapolated it to a time period. Assuming 40
years of GNUCash at around the same usage rate, it would use: 500KiB
months<sup>-1</sup> &middot; 12 months &middot; 40 years = 240MiB which to most
is acceptable for a lifetime of finances. Of course, with XML the same
calculation gives 14.4MiB, which is much better. The discrepency in size is due
to gzip compression, which is used by default on XML (GNUCash Development
Team). In the far future, GNUCash may add compression for SQLite databases, but
it does not appear to be on any developer&rsquo;s radar right now.</p>

<p>To use SQLite on Linux, extra packages may be necessary. On Debian the
<code>libdbd-sqlite3</code> package enables SQLite saving.</p>

<section>
<h3>My Accounts</h3>
<p>The main goals of personal finance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Track the money you have.</li>
<li>Track where money is going.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other goals too, like budgeting, tracking the value of assets and
allocating savings for big purchases, but all of these really emerge from
doing (1) and (2) well. In GNUCash, setting up meaningful accounts is the most
important is the most important part of solving (1) and (2).</p>

<p>I set up relatively standard accounts for assets, equity, expenses, income
and liabilities, but there are a few things that I did differently.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Assets</dt>
<dd>Mostly standard, except:
<ol>
<li>I split my accounts into <code>Assets</code> and
<code>Assets (Non-Liquid)</code>.</li>
<li>I put my Venmo as a bank asset&mdash;usually I have more money in Venmo
than I take out, so it is acting as a pseudo-bank.</li>
</ol>
it as a Bank account, because usually I will have more money in Venmo than I
take out. Additionally, I have assets split into liquid and non-liquid, which
to me just means accounts that get used vs accounts that sit around to accrue
money.</dd>

<dt>Equity</dt>
<dd>I honestly don&rsquo;t know what equity really means in this context. To
me, it&rsquo;s just a slush fund for opening balances and nothing else.</dd>

<dt>Expenses</dt>
<dd>I found that the default expense categories didn&rsquo;t align with what I
actually care about. Currently, I have major expense categories Everything
Else, Me, Social, Town House and Transit. It takes a bit of a fine-tuning, but
if you change.</dd>

<dt>Income</dt>
<dd>I have pretty standard accounts for capital gains, work, gifts and other
income&mdash;such as selling things on EBay.</dd>

<dt>Liabilities</dt>
<dd>For liabilities, I have my car loan, credit cards and my house&rsquo;s
Splitwise. I put Splitwise in liabilities, because I don&rsquo;t pay the
utilities, so I suspect I&rsquo;ll almost always have a balance in Splitwise,
hence it&rsquo;s a liability.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here is how my accounts look overall:</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s good about GNUCash is that creating new accounts does not take
a long time, there&rsquo;s a dedicated button for it (unlike Firefly
III&rsquo;s disaster of a UI). Also, if an account has no transactions, you can
delete it from the keyboard with <kbd>del</kbd>.</p>

<p>Remember that no one&rsquo;s accounts will be exactly the same. You might
have different needs a different set of expenses that matter to you. Try some
categories, and some categories never get used, delete them. If a category is
too general, and would be better served broken up, break it up.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Adding Transactions</h3>
<p>Now that my accounts are set up, I want to track my assets, expenses and
liabilities. To add a transaction in GNUCash, simply add it to the bottom of
an account ledger. Note that because this is a double-entry bookkeeping
application, each transaction you put in will appear in two accounts, deducting
from one and giving to the other.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s literally just about it. You just do this for every
transaction, and add as much or as little detail as you want. For me, I like to
have receipts, because it makes it easier to make the numbers work at
reconciliation time.</p>

<p>I <dfn title="verify entries in a ledger">reconcile</dfn> my transactions
with my bank statements each month, and make sure the numbers make
sense.</p>

<p>Although the process is pretty simple, here are a few things that still
confused me when starting out:</p>
<dl>
<dt>If you are transferring from one account to another, how can you gain or
spend money elsewhere? Or how does money get created and spent in the
double-entry system?</dt>
<dd>To gain money, you are crediting the income account&mdash;like
salary&mdash;and debiting the asset account&mdash;like checking. This is
confusing, because colloquially, we use credit to mean getting money, and debit
is the opposite, so it must mean losing money.
<abbr title="Dividend, Expense, Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue">DEALER
</abbr> is an acronym that can help. DEA&mdash;dividend, expense and asset are
debit balances, or a high debit means more money. LER&mdash;liability, equity,
revenue are credit balances, or a high credit means more money. GNUCash
abstracts this by using less formal names such as Deposit and Withdrawl, making
it easier, but it is still helpful to know what the formal names are.</dd>

<dt>Do you need to have an account for every place you spend money?</dt>
<dd>You do not need an account for every place you spend money, unless you are
a business that deals with a few big suppliers or customers. However, regular
people spend money in many different stores and places, so it is usually a lot
more useful to make accounts as meaningful spending categories than individual
stores.</dd>

<dt>How do I record my assets before installing GNUCash?</dt>
<dd>Everything goes into <code>Equity::Opening Balances</code>, which is just
like a slush fund for money before you started to use the accounting software.
Unless you have a record of every transaction you have ever made since your
first dollar, then this category is necessary.</dd>

<dt>Where does income come from?</dt>
<dd>Income comes from the income category. It is typically credited to the
income category, and debited to the asset category.</dd>

<dt>How to deal with stocks going up or dividends?</dt>
<dd>Transfer the income from the Capital Gains account into the account where
the dividend is going into. For stocks going up, you can use the security
editor located in <code>Tools&rarr;Security Editor</code></dd>

<dt>How do I deal with assets like a car or house?</dt>
<dd>Make a transaction for an asset with the amount you paid for the asset as a
debit in its own <code>Car</code> asset account, and a credit to the car loan
liability account. In personal finance, you do not typically track the value of
a fixed-asset.<sup>1</sup></dd>
</dl>

<p><sup>1</sup>I personally do not agree with this, because I think it is
important to know net-worth, but it is a bit less work, and is the standard for
personal finance, so I follow this recommendation at least for now.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>The Day Book</h3>
<p>The biggest disadvantage is the lack of a good mobile app for GNUCash. Not
that it would be particularly hard to make one that is cross platform, since
SQLite is literally everywhere. However, in order to deal with this downside,
I have turned to a different strategy: the day book.</p>

<p>I now carry a notebook around everywhere, and this notebook has a pocket
that I can put physical receipts into. This is really useful, because I have a
singular place where I know the unreconciled receipts are.</p>

<p>I found that an A6 notebook works best. It so happens that I bought a
Leuchttrum1917 A6 notebook back in Summer 2016, so it&rsquo;s nice that
I&rsquo;ve finally found a better use for it&mdash;I originally used it back in
high school to keep track of who has a crush on whom, but didn&rsquo;t keep it
up. I really like that it has a pocket not only for receipts, but also for
small bits of paper that I always seem to accrue like doctor&rsquo;s
appointment schedules.</p>

<p>Also, I have a OneDrive folder with receipts for transactions that need to
be added.</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>When choosing GNUCash, my greatest worry was that I would lose the
flexibility of generating charts in Excel, and the defaults are a bit
underwhelming. I would have liked there to be a bar chart option, but the pie
chart is good enough for now. I suspect there are some PERL add-ons that add
bar charts, but I have yet to do the work in finding them. Here is a pie chart
of my expenses for the month of August. Yes, I did spend as much money on
social expenses as I did rent and living expenses:</p>

<p>Also, I get get more granular with the charts. For instance, here are my
social expenses for the month of August. It doesn&rsquo;t look as bad when
it&rsquo;s broken up like this.</p>

<h3>Budgeting</h3>
<p>The biggest feature promoted by proprietary solutions like YNAB and Simplifi
is that they excel at making tight budgets which save you money. YNAB prefers
zero-based budgeting, which just means that every cent needs to be accounted
for each month. Simplifi is unopinionated, but gives you the tools to do
zero-based budgeting or 50/30/20 budgeting&mdash;allocating after-tax income to
50% on needs, 30% on wants and 20% into savings. GNUCash is also capable of
zero-based budgeting or 50/30/20 budgeting, but it&rsquo;s all business, and
doesn&rsquo;t babysit you when making your budget.</p>

</figure>

<p>Budgeting in GNUCash is done through its own interface, making for a more
congruent workflow. It doesn&rsquo;t force you to do zero-based budgeting, but
by giving you that choice, it really helps. Furthermore, it makes it easy to
see how you did each month with a table view and barcharts in budgeting
reports. I don&rsquo;t quite know how to make the numbers line up yet, but
I&rsquo;ll get back to you on that.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Going back to my initial goals, I think I have succeeded, at least for the
month of <time datetime="2025-08">August</time>:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;I will figure out a method&mdash;paper or
software&mdash;that can help me record my expenses, and view my assets across
all my accounts.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;I will have succeeded if all transactions across all
accounts are recorded, all transactions match and all balances on my ledger
match with the balances on the online ledgers.<br>
<em>Attainable</em>&mdash;I am limiting myself to the month of August to start,
so I do not need to record every transaction I have ever made since I was a
toddler.<br>
<em>Related</em>&mdash;by having everything across all accounts recorded for my
own records, I will have <q>clearer understanding of my finances.</q><br>
<em>Time-bound</em>&mdash;I am looking at the month of August, and must have
everything done by <time datetime="2025-09-01">September 1st</time>. (Su)
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is a lot more to a resolution than just the one month, and we
will see if I keep with the ledger, or find it too cumbersome and let it go.
It is really hard to create a new habit. Afterall, dentists spend their entire
career telling people to floss (a 45 second task), yet patients more than often
do not.</p>

<p>Whatever happens in the future, my <time datetime="2025-09">September</time>
resolution is the infamous <q>get fit.</q> I want to focus on cardio, because I
played baseball at my friend&rsquo;s party, and I was huffing and puffing. See
you next month :).
