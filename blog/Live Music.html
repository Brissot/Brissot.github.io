<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I love going to concerts, and the DIY music scene here in the DMV is
awesome! It's so cool to see local bands, and the characteristic "DC" sound.
Hardcore is my favorite; no other genre has the same physicality, and moshing
is an experience like no other. Raves are also cool.</p>

<p>While not listening to live music, I like alternative rock and indie rock:
The Strokes, Dire Straits, Phoebe Bridgers, Boy Genius, Billie Eilish, Taylor
Swift and Zach Bryan.</p>

<p>Here are some live events I've been to, with many more to come (it's also
gonna take me a while to populate this page, so check back from time to time
:))</p>

<h3>Sweet Matrimony</h3>
<p>BOYDS, Maryland&mdash;A day of matrimony and festivities! Audrey
and Victoria were today (legally) married at the Garage. Visiters
filed in to witness the start of a lifelong (6 month) marriage
for two lovers who have described their relationship as "love at
first sight". However&mdash;nothing gold can stay&mdash;and the
lifelong lovers are to be (legally) divorced after 6 months. They
will only leave each other with what could have been, had they
not previously decided to get (legally) divorced (in order to
call each other ex-wives; honestly, really really funny if done
casually and non-challantly). But that is a story for 6 months
from now. Today we celebrated a wedding of lovers ðŸ‘°ðŸ‘°ðŸ’’.</p>

<p>The festivities started early, with a welcome party and reception
allowing visitors to trickle in. Everyone was in good spirits,
with amazing outfits. Roles were assigned. I was the flower boy
:). After some karaoke and drinks, the ceremony commenced. It
went mostly smoothly, but upon objections, Nazim objected due to
it being a gay wedding. He was shouted down by the crowd. To
cristen the marriage, Audrey and Victoria threw red jello at
their thrifted wedding dresses&mdash;yes&mdash;this wedding was
also environmentally conscious.</p>

<h3>Razor Apple Noisefest II</h3>
<p>After the wedding there was a hardcore music festival, and oh, my gosh. It
was such a hype event. Literally 10 hours of hardcore sets, moshing,
headbanging and black makeup. The mosh pit must've been 120 degrees or more. It
feels like everyone came out to the Razor Apple festival.</p>

<p>Me and Savannah had initially planned on leaving at 5pm, and she
did, but my car would not start&mdash;it turned out it was an
issue with the neutral safety switch, and when my dad came the
next day he just started it from neutral instead of park. It
ended up being an excuse to stay until the very end.</p>

<p>I enjoyed more music, spoke with more cool folks about the
(legal) wedding from the morning; no one believed me. &quot;
I didn't know they did weddings here at Butcher's Orchard&quot;,
or alternatively, &quot;You gotta be joshing me&quot;. In all
cases, no one believed that I had been there since 10AM, making
it a 14 hour day total.</p>

<p>To end the night, the Garage got out the shopping cart, and my
friend Ryan did the classic Garage shopping cart spin (where you
spin someone around in the shopping cart as fast as possible).
Additionally, he gorilla press slammed the shopping cart onto the
floor. It was awesome!</p>

<p>At the end of the night, my friend Emily drove me back to the
Trumpet House to end a very long, eventful day.</p>
