          I love going to concerts, and the DIY music scene here in the DMV is
          awesome! It's so cool to see local bands, and the characteristic "DC"
          sound. Hardcore is my favorite; no other genre has the same
          physicality, and moshing is an experience like no other. Raves are
          also cool.

          While not listening to live music, I like alternative rock and indie
          rock: The Strokes, Dire Straits, Phoebe Bridgers, Boy Genius, Billie
          Eilish, Taylor Swift and Zach Bryan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some live events I've been to, with many more to come (it's
          also gonna take me a while to populate this page, so check back from
          time to time :))

            <p>
              BOYDS, Maryland&mdash;A day of matrimony and festivities! Audrey
              and Victoria were today (legally) married at the Garage. Visiters
              filed in to witness the start of a lifelong (6 month) marriage
              for two lovers who have described their relationship as "love at
              first sight". However&mdash;nothing gold can stay&mdash;and the
              lifelong lovers are to be (legally) divorced after 6 months. They
              will only leave each other with what could have been, had they
              not previously decided to get (legally) divorced (in order to
              call each other ex-wives; honestly, really really funny if done
              casually and non-challantly). But that is a story for 6 months
              from now. Today we celebrated a wedding of lovers ðŸ‘°ðŸ‘°ðŸ’’.
            </p>
            <p>
              The festivities started early, with a welcome party and reception
              allowing visitors to trickle in. Everyone was in good spirits,
              with amazing outfits. Roles were assigned. I was the flower boy
              :). After some karaoke and drinks, the ceremony commenced. It
              went mostly smoothly, but upon objections, Nazim objected due to
              it being a gay wedding. He was shouted down by the crowd. To
              cristen the marriage, Audrey and Victoria threw red jello at
              their thrifted wedding dresses&mdash;yes&mdash;this wedding was
              also environmentally conscious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Afterwards, the hardcore festival started, and oh, my gosh. It
              was such a hype event. Literally 10 hours of hardcore sets,
              moshing, headbanging and black makeup. The mosh pit must've been
              120 degrees or more. It feels like everyone came out to the Razor
              Apple festival.
            </p>
            <p>
              Me and Savannah had initially planned on leaving at 5pm, and she
              did, but my car would not start&mdash;it turned out it was an
              issue with the neutral safety switch, and when my dad came the
              next day he just started it from neutral instead of park. It
              ended up being an excuse to stay until the very end.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed more music, spoke with more cool folks about the
              (legal) wedding from the morning; no one believed me. &quot;
              I didn't know they did weddings here at Butcher's Orchard&quot;,
              or alternatively, &quot;You gotta be joshing me&quot;. In all
              cases, no one believed that I had been there since 10AM, making
              it a 14 hour day total.
            </p>
            <p>
              To end the night, the Garage got out the shopping cart, and my
              friend Ryan did the classic Garage shopping cart spin (where you
              spin someone around in the shopping cart as fast as possible).
              Additionally, he gorilla press slammed the shopping cart onto the
              floor. It was awesome!
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the night, my friend Emily drove me back to the
              Trumpet House to end a very long, eventful day.
