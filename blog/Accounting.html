<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To start off my <a href="/blog/Monthly%20Resolutions">monthly resolutions
plan</a>, my August resolution was to have a clearer understanding of my
finances. More specifically, I outlined a S.M.A.R.T goal:

<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;I will figure out a method&mdash;paper or
software&mdash;that can help me record my expenses, and view my assets across
all my accounts.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;I will have succeeded if all transactions across all
accounts are recorded, all transactions match and all balances on my ledger
match with the balances on the online ledgers.<br>
<em>Attainable</em>&mdash;I am limiting myself to the month of August to start,
so I do not need to record every transaction I have ever made since I was a
toddler.<br>
<em>Related</em>&mdash;by having everything across all accounts recorded for my
own records, I will have <q>clearer understanding of my finances.</q><br>
<em>Time-bound</em>&mdash;I am looking at the month of August, and must have
everything done by <time datetime="2025-09-01">September 1st</time>. (Su)
</blockquote>

<p>I think that I have been successful in this goal. I have looked at several
personal finance applications, and determined that GNUCash is right for me. I
now have an accurate account of my net worth, as well as the assets and
liabilities that go into my net worth. I can audit my expenses, because I have
my receipts saved into a folder <code>Receipts</code>, which are linked to the
appropriate transactions in GNUCash. As of
<time datetime="2025-09-05">September 5th</time> (my statement date), all of my
transactions are accurate down to the cent.</p>
</section>

<section id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>My main requirement going into this project is that I want the solution to
be actually used and practical day-to-day. The meme in Fig. 1 resonates with
me; it says that simple solutions are often adequate, and mastering the simple
solution can often be the right tool for the task (Maddox). In personal
finance, I think the ends of the bell curves would be Excel, but finding a
personal finance software that is close to the versatility and simplicity of
Excel should be the goal.</p>

     alt="Mastery Curve Meme">
<footer>(Maddox)</footer>
</figure>

<p>Defining specific requirements:</p>

<dl>
<dt>More Than a Spreadsheet</dt>
<dd>The solution needs to have a better workflow, and enough flexibility to do
what I could do in a spreadsheet. If the solution doesn&rsquo;t provide more
than a spreadsheet, then there is no reason to use it.</dd>

<dt>Double-Entry Bookkeeping</dt>
<dd>In a similar vein, the solution must use double-entry bookkeeping, which
improves auditability. Double-entry bookkeeping will be expanded upon later.
</dd>

<dt>Ownership of Data</dt>
<dd>The solution must let me own my own data. This  means having my ledger
stored as an easily downloadable file, or directly using the file as the ledger
on my devices. Even if my data is only locked behind a free tier, there have
been many cases&mdash;notably with Quizlet&mdash;where a subscription gets
added, locking userdata behind a paywall (Freedman).<sup>1</sup></dd>

<dt>Data Portability/Archivability</dt>
<dd>The solution bust be accessible even if the original application ceases to
exist. In practice this means that the data should be stored in a standard
format. For this, a good place to start is the Library of Congress
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/data.html">Recommended
Formats Statement</a>. It recommends line-oriented
(<abbr title="Tab-Separated Values">TSV</abbr> or
<abbr title="Comma-Separated Values">CSV</abbr>) or open formats such as an
SQLite3 database (<q>Recommended Formats Statement: Datasets</q>).</dd>

<dt>Efficient Workflow</dt>
<dd>Entering a transaction shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than it would take to
put the same transaction into a spreadsheet.</dd>

<dt>Fast as a Program</dt>
<dd>As accounting software has been around now for 40 years, the solution
should be light on system resources (CPU, RAM, Storage). Quantitatively, it
should take &lt;200MiB of RAM, &lt;10% CPU load.<sup>2</sup></dd>

<dt>Auditability</dt>
<dd>The solution must be able to keep receipts organized and digitized, so that
original documents can be consulted to discover and correct errors.</dd>

<dt>BONUS: Asset Value Tracking</dt>
<dd>The solution gains bonus points if there is a way to track the value
of <abbr title="Financial instrumuents such as bonds, stocks, mutual funds">
securities</abbr> and currencies.</dd>
</dl>

<aside>
<p><sup>1</sup>Quizlet notoriously locked up data made by users and previously
free features behind a paywall. After years of the free tier including
<dfn title="The Spaced Repetition learning mode">Learn</dfn> and
<dfn title="The fill-in-the-blank mode">Write</dfn>, in
<time datetime="2022-08">August 2022</time> Quizlet Inc. heavily
limited the free tier of Learn and Write, restricting them to 5 free uses a
day. In order to use it as you could before, a $7.99/month subscription is
required. Additionally, they removed the option to export your own flashcards
as a CSV (Freedman).
</aside>

<aside>
<p><sup>2</sup>Quake&mdash;the real-time 3D graphics game&mdash; was able to
target 8MiB of ram and 80MiB of storage (<q>Quake Isn't Earth-Shaking</q>).
There is no reason why an accounting app should take more than 200MiB of RAM
and 10% CPU load. Desktop software written in fast compiled languages such as
C++, Go, Rust and Haskell can accomplish this easily.</p>

<section id="software-suck">
<h2>Most Accounting Software Sucks&hellip;</h2>

<p>For a software application category that is 40 years old, and is just a
glorified spreadsheet, it&rsquo;s honestly impressive how bad most accounting
applications are. How is it possible that so many applications mess up UI/UX,
when all they need to do is follow the layout and bindings of every spreadsheet
software ever made? And how is it that a spreadsheet software can take more
system resources than many video games?</p>

<p>To illustrate this, here is a list of the commonly used accounting software
that I have tried or looked into, and the downsides that led me to not choose
them.</p>

<h3>Quicken Simplify and <abbr title="You Need A Budget">YNAB</abbr></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.quicken.com/products/simplifi/">Quicken Simplify</a>
and <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB</a> are fully featured, and have all
the features I would want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online banking support</li>
<li>Asset price management</li>
<li>Cross-platform support</li>
<li>Beautiful reports</li>
</ul>
<p>However, both are also SaaS products that keep all data on the cloud, so
I do not own my data, and they are disqualified.</p>

<p>Also, both rely on web interfaces, so while they can run on anything with
a web browser, a web browser is also needed to access your own ledger. A web
browser can take 1GiB of RAM, with a far slower startup than an optimized
native app. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that Intuit discontinued their stable yearly
desktop releases of Quicken, because it looks like that solution would
perfectly suit my needs.</p>

<h3>Plain-text Accounting</h3>
<p>Plain-text accounting or <abbr>PTA</abbr> has gained popularity in the last
few years with, <a href="https://ledger-cli.org">ledger</a> and
<a href="https://hledger.org">hledger</a>. As the name suggests, the idea is
that the whole ledger is stored as human-readable plain-text files, meaning
your ledger is suited for version control, with minimal line changes.</p>

<p>However, from my&mdash;admittedly brief&mdash; investigation, it appears
that plain-text accounting has some serious downsides:</p>

<ol>
<li>The claim that plaintext is a better format than popular structured formats
is dubious. You lose speed, potential compression of the data, and a lot of
tooling that you would normally get for free with something more structured
with software that are based on SQLite, XML or JSON.</li>
<li>You get nothing to start, just a couple of command line tools, making it
hard to generate reports. What ends up happening is that people create their
own tooling, where you would normally get it for free&mdash;with an
SQLite-based application reports come naturally out of <code>SELECT</code>
statements.</li>
<li>Both ledger and hledger do not have a way to attach receipts, reducing
auditability.</li>
<li>If a doomsday situation does occur, and we lose the ability to read SQLite,
that&rsquo;s, plaintext does not solve this issue. If we lose access to SQLite,
it&rsquo;s more likely that we also lose access to the <code>ext4</code>
filesystem, and logic behind the SATA connector.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Homebank</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.gethomebank.org">Homebank</a> is a pretty, functional
accounting application that does double-entry bookkeeping very well. However,
for me it doesn't have a way to attach receipts, which is one of the features
that I really wanted.</p>

<h3>Skrooge</h3>
<p><a href="https://skrooge.org">Skrooge</a> from what I gather is similar to
HomeBank, but I did not check it out because it tries to increase its search
ranking with keywords. For instance, if you search for HomeBank, GNUCash or
KMyMoney, Skrooge will also pop up. I think this is poor etiquette, so I did
not even bother to download or check it out.</p>

<h3>KMyMoney</h3>
<p><a href="https://kmymoney.org">KMyMoney</a> is really good and feature
complete, and might be a bit better than the solution I chose. It has support
for an SQLite backend, which increases the portability of data, as well as
attaching multiple documents to transactions, double-entry bookkeeping and
everything else which is expected. If I wasn&rsquo;t primarily on GTK, I would
absolutely choose KMyMoney</p>

<h3>Firefly III</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.firefly-iii.org">Firefly III</a> is flat-out the most
feature-complete software on this list. It comes with amazing reports, a
complete API, all types of accounts and many attributes you can put into each
and every transaction&hellip; it&rsquo;s just a shame that its UI also by far
the worst out of anything on this roundup.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just so much clicking to make anything happen, from reports
to adding transactions, to modifying accounts. It makes me think that someone
will come along and focus on the UI/UX to make a companion app that's actually
really good, but until then it&rsquo;s not what I will use.</p>

<h3>Actual</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.actualbudget.com">Actual</a> is a very pretty, very
easy to use accounting app. However, the big downside is that it doesn&rsquo;t
offer much more than using a spreadsheet. For one thing, it's a single-entry
accounting system, which means that it's much harder to audit expenses. If I
lose auditability, I might as well just use a spreadsheet, and that's why I did
not choose Actual.

<h3>They&rsquo;re Not Bad Options Though</h3>
<p>Despite all that I have said, I understand if you want to use the
applications that I chose to skip over. Afterall,
<q cite="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891126/">Drugs don't work in
patients who don't take them</q> (Lindenfield). If using plain-text accounting
lets you manage your finances better, leading to a better situation, then so be
it. If you don't care about having to open a web browser to view your
aggregated financial data, then by all means go ahead. It's better to use a
solution than no solution, and all of the applications are capable of doing 90%
of what the others can.</p>
</section>

<section id="gnucash">
<h2>GNUCash Does Everything&hellip; Unglamorously</h2>
<p>The accounting solution I ended up choosing is boring and unglamorous.
<a href="https://www.gnucash.org">GNUCash</a> is an old piece of software, with
its first stable release in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>. In the age of
1GiB electron applications, GNUCash&rsquo;s age is a benefit, not a downside.
I get ~100MiB of RAM usage, and less than 3% CPU usage. Additionally, there
have been close to 30 years for bugs to be fixed, for people to explore the
edges of what&rsquo;s possible, for developers to expand what&rsquo;s possible
and for an ecosystem of tools to emerge around GNUCash.</p>

<p>Getting started with GNUCash is admittedly a little bit unintuitive, but
this is more because it&rsquo;s also an introduction to double-entry
bookkeeping.</p>

<h3>Double-Entry Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>Double-entry bookkeeping is a bookkeeping strategy that requires every
transaction to have an account that money is being taken from, and an account
that money is being moved to. In this case, an account can be bank accounts,
expense accounts (really more like expense categories), equity accounts and
liability accounts (debt). Double-entry bookkeeping helps with auditing,
because every cent must be accounted for for the numbers to make sense on both
sides or <q>accounts</q> of the transaction.</p>

<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>GNUCash is written in C and Perl, which makes it suited as a fast desktop
application.</p>

<h3>Archivability</h3>
<p>One really useful part about GNUCash is that I can save my ledger as either
a plain-text XML, or as an SQLite database. Weirdly, the XML is a lot smaller
than the SQLite database, but I&rsquo;ll chalk that up to the XML being
compressed, and the SQLite currently only saving uncompressed.</p>

<p>The upside of this is that if GNUCash ceases to exist and I want to get all
my transactions, it's a matter of writing some SQL. For instance, all
transactions can be gotten with:</p>

<code>
SELECT * FROM transactions<br>
ORDER BY post_date;
</code>

<p>There is a little caveat that some of the information is hidden away in
different tables, so if GNUCash really did become abandonware, there would be
some effort required to fully reconstruct the ledger, but knowing that
it&rsquo;s very doable with all the information in a single file is comforting
to me.</p>
</section>

<section id="using-gnucash">
<h2>Using GNUCash</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to talk about the downsides of different software,
it&rsquo;s another thing to actually learn and use the supposedly <q>best</q>
solution. There are some quirks to learn, and it can be a bit confusing at
first. I will try to clarify the parts that confused me, but if there are parts
that are still confusing, feel free to reach out.</p>

<h3> Setting Up Your File</h3>
<p>To start with GNUCash, create a new file by going to
<code>File&rarr;New File</code>. Most of this is self-explanatory. When
choosing which accounts to create, don&rsquo;t worry too much about getting all
the accounts right. You can refine them to what you care about after-the-fact.
Finally, when saving, choose either XML or SQLite. I recommend SQLite, because
it&rsquo;s a lot more portable.<sup>1</sup>

<p><sup>1</sup>SQLite is really nice, because you can use standard SQLite tools
such as <abbr title="DB Browser for SQLite">DB4S</abbr> or DBeaver to view your
data. For instance, transactions can be accessed from the
<code>transactions</code> table. I have noticed that the size of SQLite
databases are significantly larger than with XML&mdash;for my ledger including
just August data&mdash;XML took 30kiB, and SQLite took 500kiB. This seems like
a lot until you extrapolate it to a time period. Assuming you use GNUCash for
40 years, you would use: 500KiB months<sup>-1</sup> &middot; 12 months &middot;
40 years = 240MiB which I think is an acceptible amount of space for a lifetime
of finances. Of course, with the XML the same calculation gives 14.4MiB, which
is even better. The discrepency in size is because the XML is compressed, and
the SQLite is not (GNUCash Development Team). In the far future, GNUCash may
add compression for SQLite databases, but it does&rsquo;t appear to be on any
developer&rsquo;s radar right now.</p>

<p>To use SQLite on Linux, you may need to install another package. For
instance, on Debian you need to install the <code>libdbd-sqlite3</code>.
<h3>My Accounts</h3>
<p>I set up accounts for all my assets, equity, expenses, income and
liabilities.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Assets</dt>
<dd>For assets, I have pretty standard accounts, as well as my Venmo account.
I don&rsquo;t think Venmo fits very well into standard accounts, so I just put
it as a Bank account, because usually I will have more money in Venmo than I
take out. Additionally, I have assets split into liquid and non-liquid, which
to me just means accounts that get used vs accounts that sit around to accrue
money.</dd>

<dt>Equity</dt>
<dd>I honestly don&rsquo;t know what equity really means in this context. To
me, it&rsquo;s just a slush fund for opening balances and nothing else.</dd>

<dt>Expenses</dt>
<dd>I found that the default expense categories didn&rsquo;t align with what I
actually care about. Currently, I have major expense categories Everything
Else, Me, Social, Town House and Transit. It takes a bit of a fine-tuning, but
if you change.</dd>

<dt>Income</dt>
<dd>I have pretty standard accounts for capital gains, work, gifts and other
income&mdash;such as selling things on EBay.</dd>

<dt>Liabilities</dt>
<dd>For liabilities, I have my car loan, credit cards and my house&rsquo;s
Splitwise. I put Splitwise in liabilities, because I don&rsquo;t pay the
utilities, so I suspect I&rsquo;ll almost always have a balance in Splitwise,
hence it&rsquo;s a liability.</dd>

<p>Here is how my accounts look overall:</p>

</figure>

<p>What&rsquo;s good about GNUCash is that creating new accounts does not take
a long time, there's a dedicated button for it (unlike Firefly III&rsquo;s
disaster of a UI). Also, if an account has no transactions, you can delete it
from the keyboard with <code>del</code>.</p>

<p>Remember that no one&rsquo;s accounts will be exactly the same. You might
have different needs a different set of expenses that matter to you. Try some
categories, and some categories never get used, delete them. If a category is
too general, and would be better served broken up, break it up.</p>

<h3>Adding Transactions</h3>
<p>So now that I have all of my accounts set up, it&rsquo;s a matter of using
the software. For this, GNUCash excels. In order to add a transaction,
it&rsquo;s a matter of adding a transaction to the bottom of the journal. I
check my transactions with my statements each month, and make sure the numbers
match. Note that because this is a double-entry bookkeeping application, each
transaction you put in will appear in two accounts, deducting from one and
giving to another.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>I was confused about how money comes in and out. Here's some
things that confused me:</p>
<dl>
<dt>How do I record my assets before installing GNUCash?</dt>
<dd>Everything goes into <code>Equity::Opening Balances</code>, which is just
like a slush fund for money before the system, unless you have a record of
every transaction and dollar to your name.</dd>

<dt>Where does income come from?</dt>
<dd>Income comes from the income category, and gets transferred to one of your
asset accounts.</dd>

<dt>How to deal with stocks going up or dividends?</dt>
<dd>Transfer the income from the Capital Gains account into the account where
the dividend is going into.</dd>

<dt>How do I deal with assets like a car or house?</dt>
<dd>Make a transaction for an asset with the amount you paid for the asset.
This doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me because the value of the asset will go up
or down, but for personal accounting this is the standard. If doing business
accounting, it can make sense to do depreciations or amortorizations, but I
guess this complexity is overkill for personal finance.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>The Day Book</h3>
<p>The biggest disadvantage is the lack of a good mobile app for GNUCash. Not
that it would be particularly hard to make one that is cross platform, since
SQLite is literally everywhere. However, in order to deal with this downside,
I have turned to a different strategy: the day book.</p>

<p>I now carry a notebook around everywhere, and this notebook has a pocket
that I can put physical receipts into. This is really useful, because I have a
singular place where I know the unreconciled receipts are.</p>

<p>I found that an A6 notebook works best. It so happens that I bought a
Leuchttrum1917 A6 notebook back in Summer 2016, so it&rsquo;s nice that
I&rsquo;ve finally found a better use for it&mdash;I originally used it back in
high school to keep track of who has a crush on whom, but didn&rsquo;t keep it
up. I really like that it has a pocket not only for receipts, but also for
small bits of paper that I always seem to accrue like doctor&rsquo;s
appointment schedules.</p>

<p>Also, I have a OneDrive folder with receipts for transactions that need to
be added.</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>When choosing GNUCash, my greatest worry was that I would lose the
flexibility of generating charts in Excel, and the defaults are a bit
underwhelming. I would have liked there to be a bar chart option, but the pie
chart is good enough for now. I suspect there are some PERL add-ons that add
bar charts, but I have yet to do the work in finding them. Here is a pie chart
of my expenses for the month of August. Yes, I did spend as much money on
social expenses as I did rent and living expenses:</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>Also, I get get more granular with the charts. For instance, here are my
social expenses for the month of August. It doesn&rsquo;t look as bad when
it&rsquo;s broken up like this.</p>

<h3>Budgeting</h3>
<p>The biggest upside touted by commercial solutions is that they are really
good at making budgets, and ultimately saving you money. YNAB prefers
zero-based budgeting, which just means that every cent needs to be accounted
for each month. Similarly, you can do the same thing in GNUCash, but the
workflow is exactly the same as the rest of the app, making for a more
congruent workflow. It doesn&rsquo;t force you to do zero-based budgeting, but
by giving you that choice, it really helps. Furthermore, it makes it easy to
see how you did each month with a table view and barcharts in budgeting
reports. I don&rsquo;t quite know how to make the numbers line up yet, but
I&rsquo;ll get back to you on that.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Going back to my initial goals, I think I have succeeded on all fronts:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Specific</em>&mdash;I will figure out a method&mdash;paper or
software&mdash;that can help me record my expenses, and view my assets across
all my accounts.<br>
<em>Measurable</em>&mdash;I will have succeeded if all transactions across all
accounts are recorded, all transactions match and all balances on my ledger
match with the balances on the online ledgers.<br>
<em>Attainable</em>&mdash;I am limiting myself to the month of August to start,
so I do not need to record every transaction I have ever made since I was a
toddler.<br>
<em>Related</em>&mdash;by having everything across all accounts recorded for my
own records, I will have <q>clearer understanding of my finances.</q><br>
<em>Time-bound</em>&mdash;I am looking at the month of August, and must have
everything done by <time datetime="2025-09-01">September 1st</time>. (Su)
