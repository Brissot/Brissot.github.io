<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>The Netherlands is low in elevation, and is where the Rhine river delta
forms. “Netherlands” comes from Austrian Habsburg documents where the province
was called “pays d’embas” (“lands down-here”), which was translated to Dutch as
Neder-landen. Eventually this became Netherlands or Low Countries. “Holland” is
the name of the province that contains Amsterdam, but because of its importance
in the Dutch Revolt, it’s often used to refer to the whole country. Dutch
people don’t like it when people do though.</p>

<p>“Dutch” originally referred to all German speakers in English, but
over time came to refer to West German speakers, and then the people
around the Netherlands.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p><strong>Hanseatic League (Late 1100s-1500s)</strong> - A Baltic Sea
trade league. Notable Dutch cities include Zwolle, Kampen and
Deventer.</p>

<p><strong>Dukes of Burgundy (1384-1482)</strong> - The French Duke of
Burgundy came to acquire much of the Netherlands by inheritance,
purchase and seizure.</p>

<p><strong>Habsburg Netherlands (1482-1797)</strong> - The Habsburg
monarchy inherited the possessions of the Duke of Burgundy, resulting in
the Habsburg Netherlands.</p>

<p><strong>Reformation (16th Century)</strong> - Calvinism, and to a
lesser extent Lutheranism spread through the Netherlands.</p>

<p><strong>Dutch Revolt (80 Years War) (1566-1648)</strong> - Due to the
despotism of Phillip II of Spain (von Habsburg), the North Dutch
provinces went into revolt. This was mainly due to high taxes and
intolerance of Calvinism. Although the Spanish were successful in all
parts of the war, Spanish resources were tied up in other areas. The
Battle of Lepanto (1571), Spanish Armada (1588) and finally the 30 Years
War (1618-1648) bankrupted the Spanish Empire, prolonging the war.
However, Spanish commitment to the war ended due to internal revolts in
Catalonia, Castile and Leon.</p>

<p>The Dutch would formally gain independence in the Peace of Westphalia
(1648).</p>

<p><strong>Republic of the Seven United Provinces (1579-1795)</strong></p>

<p>Not a very representative republic. All power held by around 2000
oligarchs, with the Stadtholder as the head of state. Stadtholders are
not kings, but chosen with the approval of the provinces.</p>

<p>Holland is the most prosperous province.</p>

<p>Very Protestant.</p>

<p>Dutch V.O.C. made them wealthy, resulting in the money to facilitate
the Dutch Golden Age.</p>

<p>Eventually, the English E.I.C. would overtake the Dutch by winning
the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784).</p>

<p><strong>Revolutionary Era (1795-1815)</strong> - The first
“sister-republic” during the Revolutionary era as the Batavian Republic
(1795-1801). Napoleon then created the Kingdom of the Netherlands and
placed his brother Louis Napoleon on the throne (1801-1806). The kingdom
would then be incorporated into the First French Empire (1806-1815).</p>

<p><strong>United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815-1839)</strong> -
Following the Napoleonic Wars, the Conference of Vienna. Would come
under turmoil in 1830 due to the Belgian Revolt of the Southern
Provinces. The Belgian Revolt came about due to dissatisfaction of the
Catholic South with the ruling Calvinist North. Formal independence of
Belgian would come with the Treaty of London (1839).</p>

<p><strong>Kingdom of the Netherlands (1839-Present)</strong> - The
Netherlands began to colonize, resulting in the 4 kingdoms we see
today.</p>

<p>During World War I the Netherlands remained neutral.</p>

<p>During the Great Depression, the Netherlands traded with her colonies
to mitigate the effects of the depression.</p>

<p>Would War II invaded by Germans; Rotterdam was firebombed and
destroyed. Dutch East Indies invaded by Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Postwar</strong> - Dutch Industry thrived, notably with Dutch
Royal Shell and Phillips. The Dutch constructed the Delta Works to deal
with flooding, and the last major flood took place in 1953. The
Netherlands joined the European Community, then the European Union.</p>
